Description: DoRothEA is a gene regulatory network containing signed transcription factor (TF) - target gene interactions. DoRothEA regulons, the collection of a TF and its transcriptional targets, were curated and collected from different types of evidence for both human and mouse. A confidence level was assigned to each TF-target interaction based on the number of supporting evidence.
